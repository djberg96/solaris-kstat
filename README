== Description
   A Ruby interface for the Solaris kstat library.
   
== Prerequisites
   Solaris 8 (SunOS 2.8) or later.

== Installation
   gem install solaris-kstat

== Synopsis
   require 'solaris/kstat'
   require 'pp'
   include Solaris

   k = Kstat.new('cpu_info', 0, 'cpu_info0')
   pp k.record

   {'cpu_info'=>
      {0=>
      {'cpu_info0'=>
         {'chip_id'=>0,
          'fpu_type'=>'sparcv9',
          'device_ID'=>0,
          'cpu_type'=>'sparcv9',
          'implementation'=>'Unknown',
          'clock_MHz'=>502,
          'state_begin'=>1105974702,
          'state'=>'on-line'}}}}
   
== Class Methods
Kstat.new(module=nil, instance=-1, name=nil)
   Creates and returns a Kstat object. This does not traverse the kstat
   chain. The Kstat#record method uses the values passed to actually
   retrieve data.

   You may specify a module, an instance and a name. The module defaults to
   nil (all modules), the instance defaults to -1 (all instances) and the
   name defaults to nil (all names).
   
== Instance Methods
Kstat#record
   Returns a nested hash based on the values passed to the constructor. How
   deeply that hash is nested depends on the values passed to the constructor.
   The more specific your criterion, the less data you will receive.

== Error Classes
Kstat::Error < StandardError
   Raised if anything goes wrong. Typically this will only occur if you
   pass bad arguments to the constructor e.g. a module name that doesn't
   exist, etc.
   
== Unsupported names
   The following names will not return any meaningful value:

   * kstat_headers
   * sfmmu_global_stat
   * sfmmu_percpu_stat
   
== Known Bugs
   You may receive a couple warnings during the build process. You
   can ignore these.

== Designer's Notes
   I have noticed that results from the cpu_stat module differ from the output
   of the 'kstat' command line tool. I am convinced that my code is correct and
   that there is a bug in the Solaris::Kstat Perl module. Unfortunately, the
   source for the version of the Solaris::Kstat Perl module that works on
   Solaris 8 and later is not available (the version on CPAN only works on
   Solaris 6 and 7).

   Thanks go to Charlie Mills for help with the 'volatile' issue.

== Future Plans
   Add snaptime and crtime information to the statistics hash.
